# üêç Snake Game with OpenCV + DroidCam

A fun, interactive Snake Game you control by moving a green object in front of your camera! This project leverages real-time computer vision via OpenCV to track a green color object, allowing you to guide the snake, eat apples, and grow your score. Play using your PC webcam or your phone camera via DroidCam.

## üéÆ Project Description

- **Real-Time Control:** Move a green object (e.g., cap, paper) to control the snake's direction.
- **Flexible Camera Input:** Use your computer's webcam or the DroidCam app to use your phone as an IP camera.
- **Game Mechanics:** The snake grows whenever the green object (snake head) touches the apple. The goal is to reach the maximum score.
- **Easy Controls:** Press `ENTER` to restart after a game over, and `Q` or `ESC` to quit the game.

## üöÄ Setup Guide

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-opencv-droidcam.git
   cd snake-game-opencv-droidcam
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python imutils numpy
   ```

3. **(Optional) Using DroidCam:**
   - Download and install the [DroidCam app](https://www.dev47apps.com/) on your phone and PC.
   - Ensure both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
   - Start DroidCam on your phone and get the IP/PORT.
   - In `snake_game.py`, update the `IP` and `PORT` variables to match your device.
